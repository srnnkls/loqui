## About

Modern language guidelines for the age of AI. Opinionated style guides that help both humans and AI assistants write better code.

## Languages

- *[Python](languages/python/)* — Types first, composition over inheritance, feature-based organization
- *[Go](languages/go/)* — Interfaces for abstraction, packages for namespacing, errors as values

## Principles

These guides share common themes:

- *Naming over comments* — Spend 5x more time on names than comments
- *Composition over inheritance* — Even in languages that support inheritance
- *Feature-based organization* — Group by domain, not technical layer
- *Parse at boundaries* — Accept permissive input, convert to strict types immediately
- *Explicit over implicit* — Make intent clear through code structure
